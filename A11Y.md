# A11Y.md - Accessibility Implementation

This document outlines all accessibility (A11Y) features implemented in this project based on the actual codebase.

---

## 1. Semantic Structure and HTML Roles

### 1.1 Use of Semantic Typography for Headings
All major screens such as `SessionAdmin`, `JoinGame`, and `Dashboard` use Material UI's `<Typography>` component with `variant` and `component` props such as `h4`, `h6`, and `h1`, ensuring semantic structure for screen readers.

```jsx
<Typography variant="h4" component="h1">
  {t('sessionAdmin')} #{sessionId}
</Typography>
```

### 1.2 Accessible Table Structure
Leaderboard and player result data are presented using semantic table elements like `<Table>`, `<TableRow>`, and `<TableCell>`, enabling assistive technologies to interpret the structure.

---

## 2. Form Labeling and Inputs

### 2.1 Labeled Form Controls
All form fields (`TextField`) in `Login`, `Register`, `JoinGame`, etc. include explicit `label` and `id` props, ensuring that labels are associated correctly with inputs.

```jsx
<TextField label={t('email')} id="email" ... />
```

### 2.2 Button Roles and Types
Submit buttons are declared using `type="submit"`, enabling screen readers to detect their role in the form context.

---

## 3. Keyboard Accessibility

### 3.1 Full Keyboard Navigation Support
Interactive components (buttons, forms, menus, dialogs) support navigation via `Tab`, `Enter`, and `Esc`. All elements are standard MUI components or keyboard-accessible wrappers.

### 3.2 Dialogs and Alerts
Dialog windows (`<Dialog>`) and alerts (`<Snackbar>`) are focusable and dismissible via keyboard input. MUI handles trap focus and ARIA attributes automatically.

```jsx
<Dialog open={showResultDialog} onClose={handleCloseResultDialog}>
```

---

## 4. Feedback and Live Region Announcements

### 4.1 Alerts and Snackbar Accessibility
All dynamic alerts use `<Alert>` components wrapped inside `<Snackbar>`, with severity indicators (success, error). These follow ARIA guidelines to be read by screen readers.

```jsx
<Snackbar open={alertInfo.open} ...>
  <Alert severity={alertInfo.severity}>...</Alert>
</Snackbar>
```

---

## 5. Internationalization Support

### 5.1 Language Context and t() Function
All text content is accessed via the `t()` translation function with access to a shared language context. This design supports future extension into multilingual support.

```jsx
<Typography>{t('login', language)}</Typography>
```

---

## 6. Color and Contrast Compliance

### 6.1 High Contrast Theme
The project uses a defined MUI theme with high-contrast colors. Primary (`#2196f3`) and secondary (`#f50057`) palettes follow WCAG AA contrast standards.

```jsx
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: { main: '#2196f3' },
    secondary: { main: '#f50057' },
  }
});
```

---

## 7. Default Fallbacks and ARIA Warnings

### 7.1 Avatar Fallback Text
Avatars fallback to the userâ€™s first initial. This is both visual and screen-reader friendly:

```jsx
<Avatar>{currentUser?.name?.charAt(0).toUpperCase() || 'U'}</Avatar>
```

### 7.2 Accessible Menu Navigation
Menu buttons include `aria-controls`, `aria-haspopup`, and other MUI-integrated accessibility props:

```jsx
<IconButton aria-controls="menu-appbar" aria-haspopup="true" ...>
```

All listed items are based on real code in this project and align with best practices from WAI-ARIA and Material UI accessibility documentation.
