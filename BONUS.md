SPA Implementation
1. Full Client-Side Routing (React Router)
All views are defined using react-router-dom with <Routes> and <Route> components.

Route transitions occur without full page reloads, preserving app state.

Implemented Routes:

/login — Login screen

/register — Registration screen

/dashboard — Admin dashboard with game listing

/game/:gameId — Game editing screen

/game/:gameId/question/:questionId — Question editing screen

/session/:sessionId — Session administration panel

/play — Player join screen

/play/:playerId — Live game for player

/results/:playerId — Player game results

All transitions between these routes occur without reloading the page.

2. State Management with React Hooks
Application state (e.g., current user, language) is maintained using React Context APIs (AuthContext, LanguageContext) and hooks like useState and useEffect.

State transitions and API interactions trigger UI updates without page refreshes.

3. No Template or Scaffold Used
The project was built manually from scratch.

No pre-built scaffolding tools (e.g., create-react-app, AI-generated templates) were used.

Styling and layout are custom-built using Material UI and fully controlled by the developer.

4. Dynamic Data Fetching
All backend interactions are handled via axios with asynchronous requests.

Responses are used to update local state and component rendering dynamically.

No reload is needed to reflect changes (e.g., game creation, session start, question updates).

This implementation fully satisfies the SPA bonus criteria as defined in the assignment and demonstrates an effective and responsive single-page design.
